(This comment is for Recommendation Systems course at PUC Chile)

In this work, _Sarwar et al._ analyze different item-based recommendation
algorithms. This is a more complete paper than the paper of my [previous post](http://blog.lukaszorich.com/recommendation-systems/2016/08/20/comment-on-slope-one-predictors-for-online-rating-based-collaborative-filtering/), because it compares the running time of the different algorithms
and also include a sensivity analysis of some parameters like the neighbourhood
size and the model size.

I couldn't find any negative comments in the paper.
