This article was published by Denis Parra and Peter Brusiovsky in 2009, and its
about the challenges we face when trying to make recommendations using social
tags.

The paper describes 3 algorithms. The first one is the classic collaborative
filtering (CCF), the second one is an enhancement of their CCF implementation
and the last one is a modified version of the BM25 algorithm.

In general I really liked this paper, because it describes very well the
algorithms they are using and their parameters. The only thing I found
questionable is that they worked with only 10 active users. It would be
interesting to see how it behaves with more users in the CiteULike dataset.
