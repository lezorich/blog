**Content-based Recommendation Systems** by *Pazzani and Billsus* is a book
chapter where the authors discusses recommendation systems based on a
description of the item and a profile of the user's interest.

The chapter describes different ways to learn a user model like decision trees,
linear classifiers and probabilistic models. But the description of the
algorithm is very high level, and if the reader doesn't read more about
those algorithms probably he wouldn't know how to implement them. So this
chapter just gives you the algorithms and its up to the reader to dive deeper
in this techniques.

When explaining the Nearest Neighbor Methods, the authors didn't mention that
Euclidean distance in high dimensional data is not a good metric.
